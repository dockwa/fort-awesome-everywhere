# Fort Awesome Everywhere!
Fort Awesome Everywhere is a **guide** and **tool** to bring CSS-like ease of use of custom Fort Awesome icon fonts to native iOS and Android development.

One of the biggest challenges to using custom Fort Awesome icon sets is mapping the **descriptive human-friendly identifiers** (like "fa-shopping-cart") to their **computer-friendly Unicode representation** ("f07a"). _Fort Awesome Everywhere_ is a **tool** that generates a json mapping file (for iOS) and an xml file for Android Studio from your custom Fort Awesome font. Below is the **guide** to _Fort Awesome Everywhere_ where you will learn how easy it is to implement in your app.

## What are icon fonts?
* Icon fonts are a very popular technique on the web where loading images can be slow and increase the size of websites unecessarily. 
* Instead of using individual image files for each icon, an icon font is a special font that has icons instead of letters, giving you infinitely scalable icons that are easily customized in CSS.
* Natively supported by CSS, making them a no brainer to use on the web when you need icons on your site. 

## Why use icon fonts?
* A **unified icon set** across all your platforms (web, iOS, Android). 
* A **single file to update** when new icons are added or changed. 
* Set or **change the color of any icon at runtime** by simply specifying a color in a layout file or in code.
* **Infinite resolution with a tiny file size**. Since icons are vector graphics, they can be scaled infinitely to any size and take up a tiny amount of space on disk.*

###### *A sample large production app's entire icon set comes in at around ~32 KB. No more @2x, @3x, hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi. Just one, tiny-file-size, infinitely scalable vector. 


 

##### Note: Font Awesome vs Fort Awesome. What is the difference? 
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a fantastic _free_ font icon set. If you only need generic/standard icons in your app, do yourself a favor and use Font Awesome; using Font Awesome natively in iOS is trivial with the help of a [third party library](https://github.com/PrideChung/FontAwesomeKit). 
* [Fort Awesome](https://fortawesome.com) is like Font Awesome, but adds the ability to upload custom icons to create your own custom font icon sets. Its fantastic for when your app or brand has custom/proprietary icons that are unique to your brand.



# iOS

### Setup 

1) Download your kit from [Fort Awesome](https://fortawesome.com/kits/), drag the .ttf file into your Xcode project, and add the `Fonts provided by application` key to your Info.plist with an entry that is the name of your font including the .ttf file extension (i.e. `myfont.ttf`). 


2) Follow the instructions [here](https://dockwa.github.io/fort-awesome-everywhere/), and add the downloaded JSON file to your Xcode project.


3) Add the [FontAwesomeKit](https://github.com/PrideChung/FontAwesomeKit) Core library to your project. If you use CocoaPods:
```ruby
'pod FontAwesomeKit/Core'
```

4) Use the sample Icon class [here](https://github.com/dockwa/fort-awesome-everywhere/blob/gh-pages/Icon.swift) and customize if needed. 


### Usage


1) Create a UIImage to show your icon in a UIImageView (easiest, has sensible defaults to work for most scenarios): 
```swift 
Icon.image(named: "camera", color: .green)
```

2) If you need to customize the icon's size and/or positioning, create an Icon object and customize as needed.
```swift
Icon.icon(named: "water", size: 26)?.image(size: CGSize(width: 20, height: 20), color: .blue)
```

# Android

## Setup 

1) Download your kit from [Fort Awesome](https://fortawesome.com/kits/) and drag the .ttf file into your Android Studio project. 


2) Follow the instructions [here](https://dockwa.github.io/fort-awesome-everywhere/), and add the downloaded ```icons.xml``` file to your Android Studio project in the ```res/values``` folder.


3) Add the [fonticon](https://github.com/shamanland/fonticon#gradle-dependency) library to your project. If you use Gradle:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.shamanland:fonticon:0.1.9'
}
```

4) In your Application's ```onCreate()``` method, call this method to load the font. 
```java 
FontIconTypefaceHolder.init(getAssets(), "YOUR_FONT_FILE_NAME.ttf");
```

5) Copy the sample Icon class [here](https://github.com/dockwa/fort-awesome-everywhere/blob/gh-pages/Icon.java) and customize if needed.


## Usage

### In XML Layout

1) Ceate a TextView in an XML layout and set its ```text``` attribute to ```@string/icon_identifier```, using the icon's identifier found in the ```icons.xml``` file we created earlier.
```xml
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/view_iconTextView"
    android:text="@string/icon_identifier" />
```


2) After inflating the layout in code, make sure to set the TextView's typeface as below:
```java
Icon.setTypefaceAsIconFont(getApplicationContext(), myTextView);
```


### In Code

#### TextView / Button:
 
1) Set the typeface and text on the TextView:
```java
String code = Icon.iconCode("camera", getContext());
if (code != null) {
    Icon.setTypefaceAsIconFont(getApplicationContext(), myTextView);
    myTextView.setText(code);
}
```

#### Drawable:

1) _For each icon you want to use as a Drawable_, you must make an XML file like the one below, save it as ```icon_name.xml``` and put the file in ```res/xml```. 
Note: The opening tag must be ```font-icon```, exactly as it is below. Change ```icon_identifier```, ```textColor```, and ```textSize``` to whatever you require for the particular icon. 

```xml
<font-icon
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:text="@string/icon_identifier"
    android:textSize="40sp"
    android:textColor="@android:color/black" />
```

2) Create the Drawable
```java
Drawable icon = FontIconDrawable.inflate(getContext(), R.xml.icon_name);
```
